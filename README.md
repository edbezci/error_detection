# Error Detection, v.001
### Logistic Regression for Natural Language Processing Classification 

***

This Python code is designed to catch erronous or fradulent content in the textual data. 
Humans are prone errors while screening textual big data. It is particular true for conducting literature reviews, or spotting fradulent entries corresponding to a particular textual data. 

This tool uses Logistic Regression in order to detect if an entry erronously labelled corresponding to a text. In its current version, this tool only conducts binary classifications such as Yes/No, Include/Exclude, Agree/Disagree, etc. 

The model is trained on 8,987 randomly chosen abstracts and titles of biomedical articles fetched from PubMed.
